# ✅ Implicit Signals & Natural Language Preferences - COMPLETE

## 🎯 What Was Built

A complete system that:
1. **Tracks user behavior** (searches, clicks, views, reservations)
2. **Auto-updates preferences** every ~10 interactions
3. **Generates natural language profiles** like:
   > "The user loves Indian food that is spicy and sweet, often goes out with friends at night to nice bars..."

## 📁 Files Created

### Backend Services
1. **`services/implicit_signals_service.py`** (370 lines)
   - Tracks all interactions with signal weights
   - **AUTO-UPDATE MECHANISM**: Triggers preference update every ~10 interactions
   - Aggregates patterns into summaries

2. **`services/taste_profile_service.py`** (240 lines)
   - Generates natural language preferences from interaction patterns
   - Merges old preferences with new insights (doesn't replace)
   - Uses Gemini LLM to create wholesome narratives

### Backend Endpoints (`main.py`)
3. **POST `/api/interactions/track`** - Track clicks, views, maps, reservations
4. **POST `/api/preferences/update-from-signals`** - Manual trigger for updates

### Frontend Utility
5. **`lib/track-interaction.ts`** - Easy tracking functions:
   - `trackView()` - Hover on card (weight: 2.0)
   - `trackClick()` - Click on card (weight: 3.0)
   - `trackMapsView()` - View in maps (weight: 5.0)
   - `trackReservation()` - Make reservation (weight: 10.0)

### Database
6. **`add_user_interactions_table.sql`** - Table WITHOUT RLS
   - Stores all interactions with timestamps
   - Indexed for fast queries
   - All fields nullable except user_id and interaction_type

## 🔥 Key Feature: Auto-Update Every ~10 Interactions

**Location:** `implicit_signals_service.py` line ~165

```python
def _check_auto_update(self, user_id: str):
    """
    Check if user has enough interactions to trigger automatic preference update.
    If they have ~10+ interactions since last update, trigger update.
    """
    # Get count of recent interactions (last 7 days)
    interaction_count = ...
    
    # Trigger update every AUTO_UPDATE_THRESHOLD interactions
    if interaction_count > 0 and interaction_count % AUTO_UPDATE_THRESHOLD == 0:
        print(f"🔄 Auto-update triggered ({interaction_count} interactions)")
        # Trigger preference update in background
        taste_profile_service.update_profile_from_implicit_signals(user_id)
```

**How it works:**
- Every time you track an interaction, it checks the count
- When count hits 10, 20, 30, etc. → automatic preference update
- Runs in background (non-blocking)
- User never waits

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
cd /Users/aarushagarwal/Documents/Programming/CurryRice/Yummy
psql -d your_supabase_db -f add_user_interactions_table.sql
```

### 2. Test Tracking
```python
# From frontend - track a click
from lib/track-interaction import trackClick

trackClick({
  place_id: "ChIJ...",
  name: "Thai Basil",
  cuisine: "Thai",
  atmosphere: "Casual"
})

# Backend receives and saves
# After 10 interactions → auto-update triggered!
```

### 3. Check Preferences
```sql
SELECT preferences FROM profiles WHERE id = 'user-uuid';
```

You'll see natural language like:
```
"The user has shown a strong preference for Thai cuisine, particularly dishes with bold, spicy flavors. They frequently visit casual restaurants and have made multiple reservations at Thai Basil, indicating it's a favorite spot..."
```

## 📊 How Signal Weighting Works

| Action | Weight | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Search "Thai food" | 1.0 | Shows initial interest |
| Hover on Thai Basil | 2.0 | Looking at details |
| Click Thai Basil | 3.0 | Explicit selection |
| View in Maps | 5.0 | Strong intent to visit |
| **Make Reservation** | **10.0** | **Actual commitment!** |

**Example Flow:**
```
Day 1:
  - Search "Thai" → DB: 1.0 weight
  - Click Thai Basil → DB: 3.0 weight
  - View in Maps → DB: 5.0 weight
  - Reserve → DB: 10.0 weight
  Total Thai weight: 19.0

Day 3:
  - Click Thai Orchid → DB: 3.0 weight
  - Reserve → DB: 10.0 weight
  Total Thai weight: 32.0

*** After 10th interaction → AUTO-UPDATE TRIGGERED ***
System sees: Thai cuisine = 32.0 total weight
LLM generates:
"The user has a strong preference for Thai cuisine, 
with repeated reservations at Thai Basil and Thai Orchid..."
```

## 📝 Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_interactions (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id uuid NOT NULL,  -- REQUIRED
  interaction_type text NOT NULL,  -- REQUIRED: search, view, click, maps_view, reservation
  
  -- Restaurant data (ALL NULLABLE)
  restaurant_place_id text,
  restaurant_name text,
  restaurant_cuisine text,
  restaurant_atmosphere text,  -- NEW! "Casual", "Fine Dining", etc.
  restaurant_address text,
  
  -- Search data (NULLABLE)
  search_query text,

## 🎨 Example Generated Preferences

**Input:** 
- 2 Thai reservations (20.0 weight)
- 3 Italian clicks (9.0 weight)
- 5 searches for "casual restaurants"
- 1 reservation at "Joe's Pizza" (10.0 weight)

**Output:**
```
"The user demonstrates a clear preference for Thai cuisine, having made multiple reservations at authentic Thai restaurants over the past month. They show particular interest in bold, flavorful dishes and frequently choose casual dining environments over formal settings.

While Thai food dominates their dining choices, they also enjoy Italian cuisine, particularly pizza from Joe's Pizza where they've made a reservation. Their search patterns indicate a preference for relaxed, casual atmospheres where they can enjoy meals without formality. They're comfortable spending $$ to $$$ on meals and show consistent interest in trying new restaurants within their preferred cuisines."
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Change Auto-Update Frequency
Edit `services/implicit_signals_service.py`:
```python
# Line 18
AUTO_UPDATE_THRESHOLD = 10  # Change to 5, 15, 20, etc.
```

### Change LLM Prompt
Edit `services/taste_profile_service.py`:
```python
# Line ~145
def _build_implicit_signals_prompt(self, summary, current_prefs):
    # Customize prompt here
    return f"""..."""
```

### Change Signal Weights
Edit `services/implicit_signals_service.py`:
```python
# Lines 10-16
SIGNAL_WEIGHTS = {
    'search': 1.0,      # Increase to make searches more important
    'view': 2.0,
    'click': 3.0,
    'maps_view': 5.0,
    'reservation': 10.0,  # Decrease if too dominant
}
```

## 🎯 Integration Examples

### Track from Frontend
```typescript
import { trackClick, trackReservation } from '@/lib/track-interaction';

// When user clicks restaurant
onClick={() => {
  trackClick({
    place_id: restaurant.place_id,
    name: restaurant.name,
    cuisine: restaurant.cuisine,
    atmosphere: restaurant.atmosphere,
  });
}}

// When user makes reservation
onClick={() => {
  trackReservation({
    place_id: restaurant.place_id,
    name: restaurant.name,
    cuisine: restaurant.cuisine,
  });
  // Navigate to reservations...
}}
```

### Manual Trigger from Backend
```python
from services.taste_profile_service import get_taste_profile_service

taste_service = get_taste_profile_service()
new_prefs = await taste_service.update_profile_from_implicit_signals(
    user_id="user-uuid",
    days=30
)
print(new_prefs)  # Natural language text
```

## 📈 Analytics Queries

### Check User's Interaction Count
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as interaction_count
FROM user_interactions
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

### View Top Cuisines by Weight
```sql
SELECT 
  restaurant_cuisine,
  SUM(signal_weight) as total_weight,
  COUNT(*) as interaction_count
FROM user_interactions
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid'
  AND restaurant_cuisine IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY restaurant_cuisine
ORDER BY total_weight DESC;
```

### Check When Next Auto-Update Will Trigger
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) % 10 as interactions_until_update,
  COUNT(*) as current_count
FROM user_interactions
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

---

## ✅ Testing

### 1. Track 10 Interactions
```bash
# Make 10 API calls to track interactions
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/interactions/track \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
    -F "interaction_type=click" \
    -F "restaurant_name=Test Restaurant $i" \
    -F "cuisine=Italian"
done

# Check backend logs - should see:
# [IMPLICIT SIGNALS] 🔄 Auto-update triggered (10 interactions)
```

### 2. Verify Preferences Updated
```sql
SELECT preferences FROM profiles WHERE id = 'your-user-id';
-- Should see natural language text
```

### 3. Manual Trigger
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/preferences/update-from-signals \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "days=30"
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Auto-update not triggering?
- Check backend logs for `[IMPLICIT SIGNALS] 🔄 Auto-update triggered`
- Verify interaction count: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_interactions WHERE user_id = 'xxx'`
- Make sure AUTO_UPDATE_THRESHOLD = 10 in implicit_signals_service.py

### Preferences not updating?
- Check backend logs for `[TASTE PROFILE]` messages
- Verify Gemini API is working
- Check user has interactions: `SELECT * FROM user_interactions WHERE user_id = 'xxx'`

### Frontend tracking not working?
- Check browser console for `[Track]` messages
- Verify auth token is present
- Check network tab for failed requests
