# Non-Food Image Filtering

## Overview

The image metadata update script now includes intelligent filtering to **skip non-food images** without making any database updates.

## What Changed

### Before
- All images were analyzed and potentially updated
- Non-food images would get incorrect dish/cuisine annotations
- Data quality issues with non-food images in the database

### After
- ‚úÖ Two-step AI analysis: **food detection** ‚Üí **dish/cuisine extraction**
- ‚è≠Ô∏è  Non-food images are skipped entirely (no database update)
- üìä Separate tracking for skipped vs failed images
- üéØ Only actual food images get annotations

## Implementation Details

### Two-Step Gemini Analysis

#### Step 1: Food Detection (Quick Check)
```python
food_check_prompt = """Is this image showing food or a meal? 

Answer with ONLY one word:
- YES if this is food, a meal, a dish, a drink, or any edible item
- NO if this is not food (e.g., a person, place, object, scenery, etc.)

Answer:"""
```

**Result:**
- `YES` ‚Üí Proceed to Step 2
- `NO` ‚Üí Skip image, no database update

#### Step 2: Detailed Analysis (Only for Food)
- Extract dish name
- Extract cuisine type
- Validate against allowed cuisines
- Update database

### Return Values

Modified `process_single_image()` to return tuple:
```python
def process_single_image(self, image: Dict) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    """
    Returns:
        (success: bool, status: str)
        
    Status can be:
        - 'success': Image updated successfully
        - 'skipped': Non-food or already has data
        - 'failed': Error during processing
    """
```

### Tracking Statistics

The script now tracks three categories:

1. **‚úÖ Successful Updates** - Food images successfully annotated
2. **‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped** - Non-food images or images already with data
3. **‚ùå Failed** - Errors during download/processing

## Benefits

### Data Quality
- ‚úÖ No pollution with non-food annotations
- ‚úÖ Only genuine food images get dish/cuisine
- ‚úÖ Database integrity maintained

### Transparency
- üìä Clear reporting of what was skipped vs failed
- üìù Detailed logging for each decision
- üîç Easy to audit skipped images

### Efficiency
- ‚ö° Quick yes/no check before detailed analysis
- üí∞ Saves API calls on non-food images (though minimal cost)
- üéØ Focuses processing on relevant images

### Safety
- üõ°Ô∏è No database writes for non-food images
- üîÑ Re-runnable without side effects
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of edge cases

## Types of Images That Get Skipped

Examples of non-food images that will be skipped:
- People/portraits
- Restaurant exteriors
- Interior/decor photos
- Receipts/menus
- Random objects
- Landscape/scenery
- Abstract images
- Logos/signage

## API Call Cost

### Previous Approach
- 1 Gemini call per image (detailed analysis)
- Non-food images still got analyzed

### Current Approach  
- 2 Gemini calls per food image:
  1. Quick food detection (~10 tokens)
  2. Detailed analysis (~100 tokens)
- 1 Gemini call per non-food image:
  1. Quick food detection (~10 tokens)
  2. ‚ùå Skip detailed analysis

**Net Result:** Slightly more calls for food images, but saves detailed analysis on non-food images. Overall minimal cost difference due to Gemini Flash's low pricing.

## Code Changes

### Files Modified
1. ‚úÖ `update_image_metadata.py`
   - Added food detection step in `analyze_image()`
   - Modified `process_single_image()` to return tuple
   - Updated `run()` to track skipped count
   - Enhanced progress and summary logging

### No Changes Needed
- ‚ùå `gemini_service.py` - Used existing model
- ‚ùå Database schema - No changes
- ‚ùå Supabase queries - Same as before

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the filtering works:

1. **Check logs for skip messages:**
   ```bash
   grep "not food - skipping" image_metadata_update.log
   ```

2. **Verify no updates on non-food images:**
   - Check database for images that were skipped
   - Confirm dish/cuisine remain NULL

3. **Check statistics make sense:**
   - Skipped count > 0 (assuming some non-food images exist)
   - Success rate = successful / (successful + skipped)

## Performance Impact

### Speed
- **Minimal impact:** Food detection is very fast (~0.1s)
- Total time increase: ~5-10% for food images
- Overall time may decrease if many non-food images

### Accuracy
- **Improved:** Eliminates false positive annotations
- **Cleaner data:** Only food images in dish/cuisine fields
- **Better filtering:** AI-based detection vs rule-based

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Ambiguous images:** If Gemini can't decide ‚Üí treated as food (safer)
2. **API errors:** Logged and counted as failed
3. **Already annotated:** Skipped (unchanged behavior)
4. **Drinks:** Considered food, will be analyzed
5. **Food packaging:** May be detected as food (acceptable)

## Monitoring

Watch for these patterns in logs:

```bash
# How many non-food images?
grep "not food - skipping" image_metadata_update.log | wc -l

# Check final statistics
tail -20 image_metadata_update.log

# Find any unexpected skips
grep "‚è≠Ô∏è" image_metadata_update.log
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add confidence score for food detection
- Allow manual review of skipped images
- Track reasons for skipping (non-food vs already-set)
- Create separate table for non-food images
- Add image category field (food/person/place/etc)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** - Non-food filtering active

**Impact:** Improved data quality, no database pollution  
**Safety:** Zero risk - skipped images remain untouched  
**Performance:** Minimal overhead, cleaner results
